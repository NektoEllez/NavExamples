# NavExamples

## SwiftUI Navigation for iOS 16+

## Project Description

This project serves as an illustrative example of SwiftUI navigation in applications designed for iOS 16 and newer. SwiftUI introduces powerful tools for managing navigation and transitions between screens, and this project highlights their use cases.

## Key Features

In this project, we showcase essential SwiftUI navigation concepts, including:

1. **NavigationView**: We employ `NavigationView` to establish a navigation stack and manage the flow between different screens.

2. **NavigationLink**: Using `NavigationLink`, we create interactive UI elements that enable users to navigate seamlessly to other screens.

3. **@ViewBuilder**: The project demonstrates the versatility of `@ViewBuilder` in crafting UI components that gracefully adapt to various iOS versions, ensuring a consistent user experience.

4. **@State**: We utilize `@State` to manage the state of specific UI elements, enabling dynamic updates and interactions.

5. **@Environment**: The usage of `@Environment` showcases how to access shared data and settings across different parts of the app, enhancing code modularity.

6. **Navigation Parameters**: Learn how to pass data between screens using various techniques such as `@Binding`, `@State`, and `@Environment`.
